# App Runtime Interfaces: Working Group Charter

## Mission

Provides APIs for the CF App Runtime and community clients for end users.


## Goals

- End users can build against a stable, reliable, performant and well documented CF API.
- End users can build against a stable, reliable, performant and well documented higher-level CF API related services.
- End users can choose from a range of CF API clients according to their needs: cli, UI and client libraries for selected programming languages.
- Community Contributors and especially the App Runtime Deployments WG can integrate a tested CF API release into the different CF distributions.


## Scope

- Provide the community with regular releases of the CF API, clients and higher-level CF API related services.
- Maintain public roadmaps for the CF API and the CF cli. Ensure a wise balance between stable APIs and clients, feature enhancements and deprecations.
- Provide a CF API suitable for the different CF deployment scenarios: from small to very large foundations, VM- and k8s-based, support for major IaaS providers.
- Provide the community with pipelines and test suites to validate functionality, compatibility and performance of the CF API.
- Provide the community with technical API documentation, end user documentation and operator documentation.
- Collaborate with the other Working Groups and evolve the cf-push experience.
- Where it is appropriate, integrate higher-level API extensions into CF API directly.


## Non-Goals

- Provide the community with 'all' language specific CF clients libraries.
